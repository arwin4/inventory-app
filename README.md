#### Simple tea inventory manager for The Odin Project's Node course

This is an implementation of [The Odin Project's Inventory App project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application). It allows users to perform CRUD operations on a tea inventory, which has two collections: categories of tea and their teas.

Please note that the [live deployment](https://inventory-app-9ktl.onrender.com/) may take up to a minute to spin back up.

This features my first use of a MongoDB database in a real project. I have decided not to use any CSS, as this was mostly an exercise in routing, JS templating, server-side form sanitization and validation, and CRUD operations.
